<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr/>

<p>My name is Justin Stickley. I currently reside in Urbana, Ohio, a small rural town in west-central Ohio.</p>

<p>Farming is my full time job.  I work alongside my dad and my brother on a farm of just over 900 acres.  Our main crops are corn and non-GMO soybeans, but we occasionally grow wheat if the market is attractive to do so. </p>

<p>Coding is a new skill for me, but one that I am finding enjoyment in learning. I hope to apply my new skills to career in software development and testing in the precision ag industry.</p>
